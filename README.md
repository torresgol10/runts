# RunTS ⚡

RunTS is a powerful, browser-based TypeScript and Node.js playground powered by [WebContainers](https://webcontainers.io/). It allows you to run secure, ephemeral Node.js environments directly in your browser without any server-side execution.

It serves as a lightweight, instant alternative to local setups for testing snippets, prototyping ideas, or exploring NPM packages.

## ✨ Features

- **In-Browser Node.js**: Powered by WebContainers for secure, local execution.
- **TypeScript Support**: First-class TypeScript support with IntelliSense and ATA (Automatic Type Acquisition).
- **NPM Package Manager**: Install and use any package from the NPM registry instantly.
- **Multi-File Support**: Work with multiple files using a tabbed interface.
- **Themes**: Beautiful built-in themes including Dracula, Monokai, and the default "RunTS Dark" (featuring TypeScript Blue).
- **Snippets**: Save and manage your favorite code snippets for quick access.
- **Environment Variables**: Securely manage env vars for your experiments.
- **PWA Ready**: Installable as a native-like app on your device.
- **Shareable**: Share your code snippets via URL.
- **Offline Support**: Works offline thanks to PWA capabilities (booting requires initial connection).
